## Requirements

Please follow the requirements of [https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan3).

## Download pre-trained StyleGAN2 weights

To download pre-trained weights, simply run:
```sh
sh scripts/download_model.sh
```
If you want to try StyleGAN-Human and the Landscapes HQ (LHQ) dataset, please download weights from these links: [StyleGAN-Human](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dlFEHbu-WzQWJl7nBBZYcTyo000H9hVm/view?usp=sharing), [LHQ](https://drive.google.com/file/d/16twEf0T9QINAEoMsWefoWiyhcTd-aiWc/view?usp=sharing), and put them under `./checkpoints`.

Feel free to try other pretrained StyleGAN.

## Run DragGAN GUI

To start the DragGAN GUI, simply run:
```sh
sh scripts/gui.sh
```

This GUI supports editing GAN-generated images. To edit a real image, you need to first perform GAN inversion using tools like [PTI](https://github.com/danielroich/PTI). Then load the new latent code and model weights to the GUI.

You can run DragGAN Gradio demo as well:
```sh
python visualizer_drag_gradio.py
```
